## Top5TrendingVenues Task
# Probably good to know:
- It's built and tested on iPhone XR (phisical) & iPhone 11 (Simulator)
- iOS version 13.6
- The "trending" endpoint (GET https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/trending) does not work as expected (always returns empty venues collection []) and I have used "search" instead
- More tests can be added if required
